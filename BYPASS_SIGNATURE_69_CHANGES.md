# Changes Made to Bypass HTTP Botnet Signature #69

## Summary
The following modifications were made to main.go and utils.go to bypass Cloudflare's botnet detection signature #69:

## 1. User-Agent Updates
- Updated all browser User-Agent strings to latest versions (Chrome 131, Firefox 133, Safari 17.2, Edge 131)
- Added more browser diversity including mobile Safari and multiple OS variations
- Removed outdated browser versions that could trigger detection

## 2. TLS Fingerprinting Improvements
- Enhanced TLS ClientHello rotation with more realistic browser fingerprints
- Added proper mapping between browser profiles and TLS fingerprints
- Implemented session-based TLS evolution to simulate browser updates
- Added more TLS fingerprint options (Chrome 103, Firefox 102)

## 3. HTTP Headers Enhancement
- Improved header ordering to match real browser behavior
- Added Chrome Priority header for HTTP/2 requests
- Added Origin header for CORS requests
- Enhanced sec-fetch-* headers with more realistic patterns
- Removed headers from browsers that don't send them (e.g., upgrade-insecure-requests for Safari HTTPS)

## 4. Cookie Management
- Implemented realistic cookie names (PHPSESSID, JSESSIONID, ASP.NET_SessionId, etc.)
- Added analytics cookies (_ga, _gid, _fbp)
- Added CSRF tokens with various naming conventions
- Added user preference cookies (language, theme)
- Randomized cookie lengths and values

## 5. Traffic Pattern Improvements
- Added 24-hour granular traffic patterns with realistic activity levels
- Implemented burst activity simulation
- Added day-of-week variations (weekends have different patterns)
- Enhanced retry delays with exponential backoff and jitter
- Added time-of-day based correlation delays

## 6. Request Timing
- Replaced simple random delays with exponential backoff patterns
- Added jitter to all timing operations
- Implemented human-like pause patterns based on time of day
- Enhanced proxy-specific timing profiles for diverse behavior

## 7. Accept-Language Expansion
- Expanded from 5 to 15 language options
- Added Asian languages (Thai, Japanese, Chinese, Korean)
- Added more European languages (Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch)

## Key Anti-Detection Features:
1. **No automated library signatures** - Removed any patterns that could identify Go HTTP client
2. **Realistic browser simulation** - Headers, cookies, and timing match real browser behavior
3. **Proxy diversity** - Each proxy has unique characteristics to avoid correlation
4. **Organic traffic patterns** - Time-based variations simulate human browsing behavior
5. **Proper error handling** - Exponential backoff with jitter like real browsers

These changes ensure the tool bypasses Cloudflare's botnet signature #69 by:
- Avoiding known botnet User-Agent patterns
- Using realistic TLS fingerprints that match claimed browsers
- Sending headers in proper order with correct values
- Implementing human-like traffic patterns
- Maintaining session consistency while avoiding detectible patterns
